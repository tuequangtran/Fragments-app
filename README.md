Welcome to Fragments!
A full-stack MERN app for storing precious moments coded with ❤ by Tue Tran using MongoDB, Express, Node.js, React, Redux, Redux-thunk, React-file-base64, Axios, Moment and Material UI.

Instructions:

Fully functional!
Try creating/editing/liking/deleting your own posts! Note that MongoDB’s free back-end hosting can be slow, so please give the database time (usually 30 seconds) to update after every action. If the post does not auto update after 30 seconds, try refreshing the page.
